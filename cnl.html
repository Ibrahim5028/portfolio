              <p class="u-align-left">*Due to an NDA, I can only disclose limited information regarding my work at Canadian Nuclear Labratories</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">During a four-month internship at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), I worked as an engineering intern for the Energy & Infrastructure Management Group. This group primarily concentrates on monitoring and managing on-site energy consumption, utility usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the group is involved significantly in infrastructure projects, including the development of new facilities and the oversight of facility shutdowns.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">In my tenure at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, I was at the forefront of formulating the Carbon Neutral Plan, setting a bold target to cut emissions by 25% by 2025, a crucial step towards the 2030 goal of carbon neutrality. This initiative was underpinned by my strategic planning in sustainability, guiding the organization towards an eco-friendly future.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">I took charge of conducting a detailed analysis and developing energy metric reports spanning five years. This endeavor revealed a significant achievement: a 10% yearly reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, marking a tangible impact on our environmental footprint.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">Leading cross-functional teams, I spearheaded infrastructure projects, enhancing completion efficiency by 12% and ensuring strict adherence to crucial deadlines. This leadership role was instrumental in improving team collaboration and project outcomes.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">I also established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for monitoring project progress and assigned leaders to drive initiatives, coupled with creating Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) flowcharts. This proactive approach enabled us to identify and mitigate potential challenges early on, ensuring smooth project execution and sustainable success.</p><br>
