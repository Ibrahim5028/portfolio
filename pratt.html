              <p class="u-align-left">*Due to an NDA, I can only disclose limited information regarding my work at Pratt & Whitney</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">In my 8-month internship at Pratt & Whitney, I held the position of Engineering Supply Chain Analyst Intern within the Supplier Quality Assurance Group. This group is primarily tasked with ensuring compliance of supplier parts with both TCCA and corporate standards. A key aspect of our work involved the thorough inspection of parts, guaranteeing their quality and adherence to required specifications before advancing to subsequent stages of inspection.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">In my role, I focused on enhancing the integrity of our products by leading the development of an inspection technique for components sourced from vendors. This initiative significantly reduced the risk of product defects, preventing more than 78 potential issues. My approach was grounded in first principles, ensuring a robust and effective solution to a complex challenge.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">Supporting the engineering design teams, I managed component design data through Product Data Management (PDM) systems. This involved updating the bills of materials (BOM) for parts received from new suppliers, ensuring accuracy and consistency in our design and manufacturing processes.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">Through comprehensive audits of 165 vendor supply chains, I ensured full compliance with corporate and TCCA aviation standards. This rigorous process underscored my commitment to maintaining the highest quality and regulatory adherence, achieving a 100% compliance rate.</p><br>
              <p class="u-align-left">Furthermore, I improved the efficiency of our vendor certification process by creating a new vendor validation form. This innovation streamlined operations by 20%, enhancing our ability to manage aviation suppliers effectively and maintain smooth operations. This effort not only optimized our processes but also showcased our commitment to excellence and operational efficiency.</p><br>
